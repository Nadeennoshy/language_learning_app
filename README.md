# language_learning_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Language learning app contains five screens:
- First screen is the home page which contains four categories
- The rest of the screens contain these categories.
- Each category contains a list that includes an image, the name in Japanese, the name in English and an audio, except for the phrases screen that does not contain an image .

In this project, I learned the following:
- How to make multiple screens and navigate between them
- How to add audioplayers package to the project and deal with it
- How to play the audio
